### Great way to stay on track while doing something is using checklist

Maybe there is a process to something or a standard way to approach things.

Use a checklist and go through every step on it.

For example, let's take my checklist for writing an article:

First thing:

1. Main topic
2. Make a list of subtopics
3. Conslusion

For every subtopic or main topic do this:

1. Topic
2. What are we doing here / What is this thing for?
3. Why are we doing it / Reasons / Why even bother looking at it?
4. How do it / Where to get it / How to achieve same effects ?
5. Practical usage / Show something to use
6. Conslusion / Final thoughts

Editing:

1. Read and correct where necessary
2. Create headers/subheaders (e.g. h1, h2, h3)
3. Add images
4. Add gifs
5. Read and correct again
6. Check with Grammarly
7. Prepare for publication
